# dotfiles
dotfiles of evenharder. Hope it grows!

## Installation
- run `checkhealth.sh` to check if good-to-have binaries are set
- run `install.sh` to copy and replace basic dotfiles and configuration

## Future Plans
- apply `kickstart.nvim` instead of `lazyvim`
- get used to `oil.nvim`
- fix buggy lazygit paging colorscheme inside tmuxinator (don't know what's going on)
- possibly add some more lazygit (or git) alias
- add some simple bashrc alias
